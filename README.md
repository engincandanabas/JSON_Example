# JSON_Example
## What is JSON?
 - JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
 - JSON is a construct used to store data and move it between different platforms.
 - JSON is text written in JavaScript object notation format.

A simple JSON example is below.

`{"name":"Joseph"};`
JSON files use the “.json” extension.

A JSON object starts with curly braces `{}` and bites. You can have in or more `key/ pairs` and these binary are separated by a comma. Next to that, a colon comes after a key to parse it from value.

### Why is JSON used?
JSON is used to exchange data between different platforms regardless of the programming language.

# JSON With Unity
In this project, a class has been created that holds character data for the character.This class holds basic data such as the character's username, level, highest score and total money.When the save button of the data written to InputFields is clicked, the operation is executed if it is empty and does not contain false values.
The subsequent actions are as follows:
 - An object of the class type we created is created.
 - Inputs from the user are appropriately assigned to this object.
 - The object is converted to json type.
 - JSON is saved to the desired location.
